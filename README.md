# Minesweeper-v1
A Minesweeper game built using Python and Tkinter as a school final project.

Developed under a tight timeline (~48 hours) while learning Tkinter from scratch.

This project helped me understand GUI fundamentals, event handling, and structuring larger Python programs under time constraints.

Further changes will be made, such as levels and better GUI.

made with lots of love -AR <3
